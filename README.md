Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Is the part of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and maintenance of software applications.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming is centered around code and software engineering is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software, from conception to maintanance.
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1, Planning and Analysis. 2, Define Requirements. 3, Design. 4, Development. 5, Testing. 6, Deployment. 7, Maintenance.
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
1, Planning and Analysis = This phase is when you evaluate the feasibility of creating the product, revenue potential, the cost of production and the needs of the end-users.
2, Define Requirements = It is critical for converting the information gathered during the planning and analysis phase into clear requiremebts for the development team.
3, Design = The original plan and vision are elaborated into a software design document that includes the system design, programming language, templates, platform to use and application security measures.
4, Development = Phase where the development team members divide the project into software modules and turn the software requirement into code that akes the product.
5, Testing = Quality assurance team perform validation testing to make sure it is functioning properly and des what is it supposed to do.
6, Deployment = The final product is delivered to the intended user.
7, Maintenance = It is the final stage of the SDLC if you are following the waterfall structure of the sftware development process.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: Agile Model arranges the SDLC phase into several development cycles, with the team delivering small, incremental software changes in each cycle. It is highly efficient and rapid. Waterfall Model arranges all the phases sequentially, with each new phase depending on the outcome of the previous one. It provides structure to project management.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Agile Model is best for software development projects that require flexibility. Waterfall Model is best for small and well defined projects.
Requirements Engineering:The discipline that involves establishing and documenting requirements.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. 
Software Design Principles:
1, Manage using a phased life-cycle plan.
2, Perform continuous validation.
3, Maintain disciplined product control. 
4, Use modern programming practices.
5, Maintain clear accountability for results.
6, Use few and better people.
7, Maintain a commitment to improve the process.
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? By breaking down the software into independent modules, you can easily adapt, extend or replace parts of the system without affecting others.
Testing in Software Engineering: The process of checking the quality, functionality and performannce of a software product before launching.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 1, Unit Testing = Testing individual units, to check on whether each unit performs according to its specifications.
2, Integration Testing = testing of interconnected units.
3, System Testing = testing the system as a whole and check if the output was able to meet the goals.
4, Acceptance Testing = Testing for acceptability and check if it meets and satisfies the client's requirements.
Version Control Systems: Softeware tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Git, Apache Subversion, Mercurial, Perforce, Azure DevOps Server, GNU Bazaar.
Software Project Management: The process of planning and leading software projects.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Laisons between the development team and other stakeholders in a software project. Risk management, Change management, planning. 
Poor planning and Unrealistic Deadlines.
Software Maintenance:The process of changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with the customer needs.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle? This means monitoring and maintaining properly. 1, Corrective Software Maintenance.
2, Preventative Software Maintenance
3, Perfective Software Maintenance.
4, Adaptive Software Maintenence.
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:
To create inclusive and accesible software that does not discriminate against individuals based on race, gnder, age or disability.
What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? Privacy, Intellectual Property, Overemphasis on features, Accountability.

Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answer.
